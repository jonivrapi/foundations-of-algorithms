# Programming Assignment 2

## Running The project

This project uses `python3`. After `pip3` installing any dependencies you may not already have, running `python3 divide_and_conquer.py` and `python3 chip_and_be_conquered.py` will run the program. At the bottom of each of those files you will find calls that run the test cases you have described in the assignment.

As part of the analysis, I have included a `tests.py` file with this package. Running `python3 tests.py` will run the program with exaggerated inputs for both divide and conquer and chip and be conquered calls.

The `utils.py` file simply serves to export some of the functionality that was needed by the assignment algorithm in an effort to make it easier for you to read.

Finally, there are three files that contain the output of running both types of recurrence relation solvers, as well as an output file for running the tests.

## List of Files

1. chip-and-be-conquered.cover
2. divide-and-conquer.cover
3. divide_and_conquer.py
4. chip_and_be_conquered.py
5. tests.py
6. utils.py
7. ProgrammingAssignment2.pdf
8. chip-and-be-conquered-output.txt
9. divide-and-conquer-output.txt
10. tests-output.txt
11. README.md

All `.cover` files are trace files. All `.py` files are code files. The `.pdf` file is my compiled latex for this assignment.
