# Programming Assignment 2

## Running The project

This project uses `python3`. After `pip3` installing any dependencies you may not already have, running `python3 quicksort.py` and `python3 median_of_three.py` will run the programs. At the bottom of each of those files you will find calls that run the test cases that produce the output used in the analysis portion of the write-up.

Finally, there are two files that contain the output of running both quicksort programs.

## List of Files

1. quicksort.cover
2. median_of_three.cover
3. quicksort.py
4. median_of_three.py
5. ProgrammingAssignment3.pdf
6. quicksort_output.txt
7. median_of_three_output.txt
8. README.md

All `.cover` files are trace files. All `.py` files are code files. The `.pdf` file is my compiled latex for this assignment.
