\textbf{Problem 1d.} This algorithm processes the signal "as it comes in" via a single for loop which iterates through the input string only once for an $O(n)$ time. There are many comparisons that are made, all of which are $O(1)$ operations. Finally, to get the noise in the signal, it generates another array of size $m < n$ in $O(m)$ time. In total, this is $O(n) + O(m)$ which is linear with respect to inputs, so this is an $O(n)$ algorithm.
