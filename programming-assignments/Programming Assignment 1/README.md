# Programming Assignment 1

## Running The project

This project uses `python3`. After `pip3` installing any dependencies you may not already have, running `python3 ProgrammingAssignment1.py` will run the program a single time with `n = 10` input points, choosing `m = 5` of those to return to you. These values are modifiable by you by editing the `n` and `m` variables at the top of the file.

As part of the analysis, I have included a `charts.py` file with this package. Running `python3 charts.py` will run the program with `[5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000]` input points, which will produce a scatter-plot that plots the number of iterations relative to the number of inputs. Closing the chart that pops up after running this command will end the program.

Finally, the `utils.py` file simply serves to export some of the functionality that was needed by the assignment algorithm in an effort to make it easier for you to read.
